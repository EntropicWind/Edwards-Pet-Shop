# Full Stack Single Page Project: Creating the back-end and front-end to send request and respond to a single webpage

This project required me to:

- build out a database in PSQL and fill it with information,
- create a server and server js,
- create the js using event listeners,
-  make an AJAX call to a personally built database,
- jQuery manipulation based on user interaction with the app,
- and CSS to make it look good

## Creating the Idea for the Project

I decided to go with the pet store theme to keep things simple. I created my own database and populated it with informaton and a server to do all the talking. 

## What This Project Does

For this project, I wanted to incorporate the full stack development on a single webpage. On the page you click a button to show Owners, it makes a requst and then populates the data. You click clear and it clears it out. The Same thing applies to the Pets button. 

To make this happen, I used the self created database along with my server to satisfy the need for request/response.
